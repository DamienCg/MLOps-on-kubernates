# Vanilla Mlops schema with dockerization

## Simple Workflow for MLOps Architecture Federated Learning Ready
This repository contains a simple workflow for the key components of an MLOps architecture prepared for Federated Learning. Federated Learning is a methodology that allows training machine learning models on distributed data without the need to centralize such data. This approach is particularly suitable for scenarios where data privacy is a priority.

## usage
```bash

docker-compose up
