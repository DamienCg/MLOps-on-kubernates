# Vanilla Mlops schema with dockerization

## Simple Workflow for MLOps Architecture Federated Learning Ready
This repository contains a simple workflow for the key components of an MLOps architecture prepared for Federated Learning. Federated Learning is a methodology that allows training machine learning models on distributed data without the need to centralize such data. This approach is particularly suitable for scenarios where data privacy is a priority.

## MLOps Schema:

The image below illustrates the MLOps architecture, a framework that seamlessly navigates from model prototypes to production implementation, enhancing the management, maintenance, and continuous iteration of machine learning models while preparing the infrastructure for a transition to a federated learning system.
